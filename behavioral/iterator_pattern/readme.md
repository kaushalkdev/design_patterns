## Iterator Pattern

### About
This pattern provides an interface to iterate through the elements of the collection whose way of implementtion is kept hidden.


### Structure
- An iterator interface which has `hasNext()` and `next()` which retrives the next method.
- Concrete implementation of iterator.
- Aggregator which has creates the iterator and which holds the collection to be traveresed. 

Currently i have implemented basic list based iterators.
