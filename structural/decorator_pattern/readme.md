## Decorator Pattern

Generally adds some extra configrations / properties to exsiting object instances on run time.
It solves the problem where we need differnet combinations of existing class properties and using inheritence may exponentially increase the number of classes.

Also addition of these properties are at run timebut in case of inheritance we need to create fresh concrete implementations of classes to support differnt kind of combinations.
